    Elevated Trading sources our hemp products exclusively from the Rogue Valley
    of Southern Oregon. Rogue Valley is commonly referred to as the “Napa Valley
    of Hemp” due to the premium quality, sun-grown hemp consistently delivered
    year after year. 

    The region’s unique microclimate, superior soil quality and responsible farming practices all unite to deliver a CBD product that simply outperforms other regions in the United States.

farming:
  heading: Equity Driven Farms
  description: >-
    Let’s face it, without the cultivators putting in the hard work during the
    grow season and choosing to grow hemp on their farms, the CBD industry would
    not be possible. We’re passionate about delivering the highest value for our
    customers while ensuring that Rogue Valley hemp cultivators are profitable
    and able to reinvest for future harvests.

    Elevated Trading has done the “leg work” and vetted farms extensively to form strategic partnerships with the premier grow operations and extraction facilities in Southern Oregon. Our customers are welcome to visit our farms and extraction facilities to see how much care and effort goes into maintaining a premium, compliant, and consistent portfolio of products.
