    farmers through rigorous testing protocols before pulling their products
    into our portfolio.

    Let’s face it, without the cultivators putting in the hard work during the
    grow season and choosing to grow  our wholesale hemp flower on their farms,
    the CBD industry would not be possible. We’re passionate about delivering
    the highest value for our customers while ensuring that the farming
    community is profitable for future harvests.

    Elevated Trading has done the “leg work” and vetted farms extensively to form strategic partnerships with the premier grow operations and extraction facilities across the country. Our customers are welcome to visit our farms and extraction facilities to see how much care and effort goes into maintaining a premium, compliant, and consistent portfolio of wholesale hemp products.
