#### Shipping Policy

Our goalis to ship all orders within 1-2 business days after receiving payment (excludes holidays). This includes any shipments that are drop shipped by our various vendors. If there will be a significant delay in your purchase, you will be contacted by a customer service representative to discuss alternate products or begin processing a full refund.

All orders containing hemp flower are professionally packaged including a “Notice to Law Enforcement” describing a legal hemp shipment along with a copy of the Certificate of Analysis for the products enclosed.

We ship products using legal methods via USPS/UPS, and tracking information will be provided to you once the shipment leaves our facilities. Once in transit via USPS/UPS, Elevated Trading cannot be held responsible for stolen orders, items lost in transit, undelivered items, or mistakenly seized items.

#### Return Policy

To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused, original seal intact, and in the original packaging. Our return policy lasts 14 days from date of purchase, and return inquiries must be submitted via email to info@elevatedtrading.com within 14 days to be eligible for a refund. Buyer is responsible for shipping costs on returned items.

This return policy does exclude hemp flower which is non-refundable. That said, customer satisfaction is our top priority. If there is an issue with your order of hemp flower, please contact your account manager or email us at info@elevatedtrading.com, and we will do everything in our power to find a suitable resolution.

If you happen to receive the wrong product, please contact us immediately so we can rectify the situation. Elevated Trading, LLC will cover the return shipping costs if the wrong products are delivered in your order.

#### Exchange Policy
