## Why the Demand for CBD Flower?

Before we dive into the top strains, let’s get you up to speed on the demand for CBD flower. Hemp flower is the fully dried bud from the hemp plant. The dried flower comprises of a full array of cannabinoids as well as terpenes — a compound that gives plants their alluring scents. The hemp plants contain a much higher concentration of CBD than its counterpart THC plants.

### The 2018 Farm Bill

Demand for CBD-rich hemp flower is astonishing. Hemp is defined in the 2018 Farm Bill as having less than 0.3 percent THC. Consumer demand is increasing for those who want the full-spectrum benefits of cannabis without the psychoactive effects. What does this mean?

CBD-rich hemp flower and THC cannabis flower are essentially the same in terms of cultivation and processing but differ in dominant cannabinoids. Many consumers turn to CBD-rich hemp flower — because it looks, smells, tastes, and smokes like THC — without the high.

### Legal domestic cultivation

Why is this important to retailers? According to [the Brightfield Group](https://www.brightfieldgroup.com/), the hemp-derived CBD market is growing faster than the legal THC market. Because domestic hemp cultivation is legal, they predict it will be a \$22 billion industry by 2022.
