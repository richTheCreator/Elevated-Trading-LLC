At Elevated Trading, we’re in conversations with retailers across the country every day. It’s not surprising that we get to learn a lot about the different CBD markets and how consumers are educating themselves when it comes to high quality [CBD flower](https://www.elevatedtrading.com/products). Increasingly, retailers and consumers alike are realizing it’s not just the CBD percentage, but how big of an impact terpenes make on the overall experience.

Variations in terpene strains and content significantly alter the physiological effects that hemp has on a user. What does this mean? Terpenes enhance the benefits of CBD hemp via the endocannabinoid system. When combined with CBD, terpene blends create a more balanced and pleasant experience and encourage users to be more focused, have more energy, or be calmer.
