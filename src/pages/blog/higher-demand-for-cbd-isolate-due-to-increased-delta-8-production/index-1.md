# Higher Demand for CBD Isolate Due to Increased Delta 8 Production



One of the many cannabinoids in the hemp plant, Delta 8 — is a close relative of the widely known, psychoactive cannabinoid of THC, Delta 9. Delta 8 now represents one of the fastest-growing segments in the CBD market today.

And as the notorious Delta 8 cannabinoid gains traction, we see a higher demand for CBD isolate. CBD isolates are the purest CBD products available on the market, produced by extracting all plant components including terpenes, flavonoids, and cannabinoids. 

Pricing is all over the map — and Elevated Trading wants to provide top-level guidance on the importance of working with a supplier that can deliver consistent supply at a fair price. 

As of December 2020, the [average daily CBD isolate prices](http://www.mckeany-flavell.com/cbd-isolate-pricing-rises-despite-drop-in-sales-12-23-20/) were at a five-month high and almost 10 percent higher than in October. With the average cost of CBD isolate per kilo as of January 2020 at $1,624 — how do you determine a fair price?

## What is CBD Isolate?

[CBD isolate](https://www.elevatedtrading.com/products/cbd-isolate/) is cannabidiol in its most refined form. The chemical compound is created by isolating or extracting it from the hemp plant. One of the most engaging attributes of CBD isolate for consumers is the nonexistence of THC, meaning consumers can acquire the health benefits of without experiencing the high.

CBD isolate contains no additional cannabinoids, terpenes, additives, or flavonoids. To be recognized as a CBD isolate, a product must have at least 98 percent pure CBD. CBD isolate is only sold in a dry, white powdery form — and is odor-free and tasteless. 

Elevated Trading CBD Isolate is a pure, crystalline, and flavorless pharmaceutical grade powder that is 99+% pure CBD. This results from the refining process once everything has been removed except for the CBD molecules themselves.

## Delta 8 Driving CBD Isolate Demand and Prices

Today, CBD isolate powder is used to manufacture Delta 8-infused gummies, vape carts, and gel caps. Delta 8 has stimulated massive demand for CBD isolate. 

While nobody has a roadmap for how the elements of policy or supply chains will develop during the Delta 8 demand — you can lower CBD isolate costs when you buy wholesale.

When it comes to a CBD retails shop, you also want to make sure that your suppliers provide you with consistent, top-quality CBD isolate. Our CBD isolate is affordably priced and ships within 24-48 hours of receipt of payment.
