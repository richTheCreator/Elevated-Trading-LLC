Products comprising of delta-8 are flourishing across the hemp-derived CBD industry. If you’re like most retailers, you may be wondering how to choose safe, reliable delta-8 distillate for your store. Elevated Trading has put together this guide to help clear up some of the unknowns surrounding delta-8.

Cannabidiol (CBD) and delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are the two rich cannabinoids. Discovered in the 1970s, delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol is another abundant cannabinoid. CBD is non-psychoactive and found in high concentrations in hemp plants. At the same time, THC is the psychoactive compound in cannabis plants, renowned for its ability to produce intoxicating effects.

**What is Delta 8?**

Delta-8 is an isomer of delta-9 THC. Typical cannabis plants can have THC levels reaching above 20 percent, whereas delta-8 THC levels remain significantly less than 1 percent (trace amounts). Certainly not a new kid on the block, delta-8 has recently fueled-up the retail side of the hemp industry. When hemp derived, it’s legal, prevalent, therapeutic — and now — widely accessible.

Consumers can find delta-8 products in many of the same forms as CBD products, including:

* Delta-8 Tinctures
* Delta-8 Vape Cartridges
* Delta-8 Gummies
* Delta-8 Gel Caps
* Delta-8 Dabs
* Delta-8 Hemp Flower

**The Difference Between Delta-8 and Delta-9 THC**

Although the end-user effects of delta-8 and delta-9 THC are different, the molecular structures are astonishingly comparable. Scientifically speaking, only one double bond separates delta-8 from delta-9 THC molecules. The word delta describes the important double bond. Delta-8 has a double bond on the eighth carbon, while delta-9 THC has a double bond on the ninth carbon on the molecule’s chain.

Research indicates delta-8 enables consumers to feel less anxiety-provoked, less sedated, and produces a clear-headed ambiance.

**Where to Buy Delta-8 Products**

For retailers, it’s crucial to buy delta-8 distillate from a reputable vendor who sells hemp-derived CBD products.

**Elevated Trading Insider Tip:** Always ask to see the product’s Certificate of Analysis (COA). A COA is an official report from an unbiased third-party lab that has analyzed the product. **Retailers should refuse to buy any hemp-derived product from a company that won’t provide third-party lab results.**

* The percentage of delta-8 in the product
* If any, the amount of THC in the product
* The concentration of other cannabinoids

Find a vendor that produces high-quality delta-8 distillate with a fair price. While there is an abundance of companies to choose from, choose a supplier you can trust. Elevate.
