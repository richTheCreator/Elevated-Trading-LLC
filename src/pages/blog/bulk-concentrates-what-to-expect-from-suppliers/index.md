If you’re searching for bulk CBD/CBG/CBN concentrates, Delta 8, or shelf-ready retail products, we’re elevating the supply chain experience across the wholesale hemp industry. Our wholesale concentrates are formulated in premier laboratories across the United States, ensuring we deliver compliant, top-quality products at the most competitive prices.

The most significant factor when buying wholesale CBD concentrate is the quality of the product. As we mentioned earlier, the CBD market is thriving with reputable suppliers — and unfortunately, also a gamut of less than reputable companies. 

The goal at [Elevated Trading](https://www.elevatedtrading.com/) is to provide all manufacturers — big or small — access to our high-quality products. We understand there are many options out there and knowing how to find a high-quality bulk concentrate supplier is critical. 

## What to Expect from a CBD Concentrate Supplier?

1. ### Elevated Trading Offers Full Chain of Custody Documents

Elevated Trading offers access to consistent quality bulk concentrates and provides full panel third-party testing on each product — and a trackable chain of custody. We meticulously maintain control from seed to concentrate to ensure that you are getting the best CBD products on the market. 

Elevated Trading Insider Tip: Request Chain of Custody documents from any supplier you choose to work with. Do not work with any supplier who doesn’t provide this information. 

2. ### Highest-Quality Tamper-Evident Concentrate Packaging

Here at Elevated Trading, for example, our [Delta 8 distillate](https://www.elevatedtrading.com/products/delta-8-distillate/) comes in tamper-evident, aluminum bottles to ensure safe delivery. Why do we do this? The polyethylene liner of the bottle helps trap oxygen to help preserve the consistency of your product. The tamper-evident seals keep the product secure until it reaches its final destination. All our packaging solutions help your product stay safe, fresh, and potent.

Elevated Trading Insider Tip: Ask the supplier what packaging they use to ship the product. Most of the industry uses cheap Pyrex and plastic. Practice buyer-awareness and protect your investment. 

3. ### Sample Syringe for Independent Lab Analysis 

All Elevated Trading products are third-party tested for quality. We provide a [Certificate of Analysis (CoA)](https://www.elevatedtrading.com/lab-results) for all our hemp-derived CBD products so that you may easily discern the contents and ingredients. 

Elevated Trading Bonus: We include a sample syringe in every order for our customers to conduct an independent lab analysis (should they choose to do so), which speaks to our company’s transparency.
