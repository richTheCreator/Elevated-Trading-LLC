The rise of products containing cannabinol (CBN) is intensifying worldwide, including in [Elevated Trading products](https://www.elevatedtrading.com/products/) — as the synergy created by this cannabinoid results in unique, sedative effects.

Without impairing one’s ability to function, CBN is highly favored for the way it calms the body. While CBN has also shown positive research benefits for sufferers of glaucoma, psoriasis, bacterial infection, and pain — sleep is what CBN fans are most thrilled about.

While CBN is becoming increasingly popular as a potential replacement for medications to improve sleep, it is harder to find than CBD. Elevated Trading now makes it more accessible.

## **What is CBN?**

The last few years have created an evolving knowledge base of cannabinoids. [Cannabinol (CBN)](https://www.elevatedtrading.com/products/cbn-isolate/) is one of the more than 200 cannabinoids produced by the cannabis plant.

CBN is the cannabinoid from which tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) breaks down after prolonged periods. The degradation can be accelerated by exposing dried plant matter to oxygen and heat.

Like CBG, CBN is a non-intoxicating compound found to have some medicinal and therapeutic potential. Research shows that CBN — is a sedative cannabinoid with higher efficacy than most pharmaceuticals offering a maximum calming effect while helping your brain get the rest it needs.

The most common CBN product used and available on the market today is CBN oil. 

## **The Benefits of CBN**

CBN interacts with the body's endocannabinoid system (ECS). It can influence the function of many hormones and neurotransmitters, which influences mood, energy, cognition and focus, appetite, immune function, and pain.

### **Sedative**

Research suggests that CBN can prolong sleep time on top of its already considerable sedative powers. Its powerful sedative capabilities have opened the door for CBN as a powerful sleep aid — an option for patients who have insomnia and other sleep disorders.

### **Pain Relief**

Recent studies have suggested that CBN influences pain relief by altering pain signals sent to the brain by neurons.

### **Antibiotic**

Research shows CBN can fight bacteria. A 2008 study found CBN one of several cannabinoids (including CBD) effective in treating MRSA, a bacterial infection resistant to antibiotics. 

### **Anti-Inflammatory**

Like CBD, CBN appears to have anti-inflammatory capabilities. Cannabinoids, including CBN, are being examined for their possible therapeutic role with inflammatory disease. 

### **Appetite Stimulant**

While CBD has appetite-suppressing effects, CBN appears to stimulate the appetite. This may make CBN a therapeutic option to boost appetite for individuals who fight to sustain an appetite because of illness, such as cancer — or its treatment. 

### **Cancer Fighter**

There’s some promising preliminary evidence that CBN may have direct cancer-fighting capabilities. Cannabinoids, including CBN, are being analyzed for their capacity to slow or stop the growth and spread of cancer cells. Research will continue to determine how viable CBN is in this regard.

### **What is the Difference between CBN and CBD?**

CBD is short for the word cannabidiol. CBN is short for the word cannabinol.

The key distinction between these two cannabinoids is that CBN cannot be found in the hemp plant, instead it evolves from THC degradation. CBN is an outcome of developments within the plant and the amount hinges on various factors, such as the levels of THC and its exposure to elements such as light, heat, and time.

Apart from the chemical formula, CBN and CBD interact with the human endocannabinoid system in relatively different ways. CBD shows slight resemblance to the CB1 and CB2 receptors found in the nervous and immune systems. Instead, it boosts the production of endocannabinoids that promote homeostasis.
