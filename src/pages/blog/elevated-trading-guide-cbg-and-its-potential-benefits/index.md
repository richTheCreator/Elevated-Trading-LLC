# Elevated Trading Guide: CBG and its Potential Benefits



Boom. The cannabinoid market is on the rise. CBG (cannabigerol) is quickly exploding worldwide, including in [Elevated Trading](https://www.elevatedtrading.com/) products — as the synergy created by cannabinoid combinations results in improved effectiveness and maximum results.

There is no doubt CBD changed the culture, providing consumers with several health and wellness benefits. But CBG, recently receiving more attention for its potential uses for health and wellness, paves the way for endless possibilities and adaptations. 

Does the lesser-known cannabinoid CBG — live up to its hype? Our goal here is simple, to provide retailers with information on CBG in a straightforward and intuitive way.

## What is CBG?

Hemp-derived CBG is a nonintoxicating substance. CBG is a non-acidic cannabinoid generated when ultraviolet light or heat is applied to a CBGA (cannabigerol acid) molecule. 

It is a crucial wellness component of the hemp plant and is touted as 'The Godmother' as most CBG is converted into other cannabinoids within the hemp plant. 

CBG strains produced for THC usually contain exceptionally low amounts of CBG (less than 1 percent). CBD strains, on the other hand, have much higher concentrations of this essential minor cannabinoid.

So, why the hysteria over CBG? With an enhanced understanding of cannabis and cannabinoids today — research and exploration have introduced scientists to many new cannabinoids besides the more well-known THC and CBD.

[CBG Distillate](https://www.elevatedtrading.com/products/cbg-full-spectrum-distillate/). Elevated Trading's wholesale CBG distillate is refined in a highly controlled environment to ensure the highest quality on the market. Our distillate has a golden to amber hue and the consistency of honey when warmed. We recommend using in vape cartridges, tinctures, gummies, chocolates, caramels, and other edible products where maintaining delicate flavors is essential.

[CBG Isolate](https://www.elevatedtrading.com/products/cbg-isolate/). CBG Isolate is a pure, crystalline, and flavorless pharmaceutical grade powder that is 99+% pure CBG. Isolate is the only way to achieve true zero THC present end products. Isolate is useful for nearly every CBG product on the market when minor cannabinoid and phytocannabinoid flavors are not desired. 

[CBG Full-Spectrum Oil](https://www.elevatedtrading.com/products/cbg-full-spectrum-oil/) (Crude). Crude refers to the base product produced after the initial extraction process. This "crude" oil still contains Chlorophyll, terpenes, flavonoids, and phytocannabinoids, giving it a dark green to black hue. Crude is optimal for products that require a low price point where protecting flavor is not a concern. We recommend using in gel caps, pain creams, lotion, topicals, and tinctures where the natural flavors of the plant are encouraged.

## The Potential Benefits of CBG

Advances in extraction and isolation technologies have allowed researchers to isolate many cannabinoids, including CBG. Let's take a closer look at the benefits.

Research is relatively sparse regarding the therapeutic benefits of CBG, but studies are linking the compound to a multitude of potential therapeutic benefits.

CBG reportedly helps support inflammation, pain, nausea and works to slow the proliferation of cancer cells. Research shows it can significantly reduce intraocular eye pressure caused by glaucoma. Strains high in CBG are also shown to support conditions such as [inflammatory bowel disease](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23415610/), Crohn's disease, and [colon cancer](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25269802/).

What is the Difference between CBG and CBD?

While CBG is similar to CBD in that it is non-psychoactive, CBG and CBD differ in numerous ways:

* Molecular Structure. Cannabigerol and cannabidiol have complex molecular structures. Molecular structure refers to the number and arrangement of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen atoms that establish a cannabinoid. 
* Antagonist. CBD and CBG stimulate receptors differently. CBD appears to exert its anti-nausea effects through its affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor, acting as an agonist (activator) whereas [CBG acts as an antagonist (blocker) at the 5-HT1A receptor](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25269802/). 
* Appetite Stimulation. CBG differs from CBD when it comes to appetite stimulation. Research shows that doses of [CBG encouraged the animals to eat more](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22543671/) than double their average food intake. 

With interest in CBG on the rise, expect to see and hear more about this unique cannabinoid in the news and right here on our Elevated Trading blog. Let's elevate!
