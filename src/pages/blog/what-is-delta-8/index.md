Products comprising of Delta 8 are flourishing across the hemp-derived CBD industry. If you’re like most retailers, you may be wondering how to choose safe, reliable Delta 8 distillate for your store. Elevated Trading has put together this guide to help clear up some of the unknowns surrounding Delta 8.

## Delta 8 Explained

Cannabidiol (CBD) and Delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are the two rich cannabinoids. Discovered in the 1970s, Delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol is another abundant cannabinoid. CBD is non-psychoactive and found in high concentrations in hemp plants. At the same time, THC is the psychoactive compound in cannabis plants, renowned for its ability to produce intoxicating effects.

Delta 8 is an isomer of Delta 9 THC. Typical cannabis plants can have THC levels reaching above 20 percent, whereas Delta 8 THC levels remain significantly less than 1 percent (trace amounts). Certainly not a new kid on the block, Delta 8 has recently fueled-up the retail side of the hemp industry. When hemp derived, it’s legal, prevalent, therapeutic — and now — widely accessible.

### The Difference Between Delta 8 and Delta 9 THC

Although the end-user effects of Delta 8 and Delta 9 THC are different, the molecular structures are astonishingly comparable. Scientifically speaking, only one double bond separates Delta 8 from Delta 9 THC molecules. The word delta describes the important double bond. Delta 8 has a double bond on the eighth carbon, while Delta 9 THC has a double bond on the ninth carbon on the molecule’s chain.

Research indicates Delta 8 enables consumers to feel less anxiety-provoked, less sedated, and produces a clear-headed ambiance.

#### The National Cancer institute says [this](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-drug/def/delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol?redirect=true) about Delta 8

> **Delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol** is an analogue of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) with antiemetic, anxiolytic, appetite-stimulating, analgesic, and neuroprotective properties. Delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-8-THC) binds to the cannabinoid G-protein coupled receptor CB1, located in the central nervous system; CB1 receptor activation inhibits adenyl cyclase, increases mitogen-activated protein kinase activities, modulates several potassium channel conductances and inhibits N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels. This agent exhibits a lower psychotropic potency than delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC), the primary form of THC found in cannabis

## Where to Buy Delta 8 Products

### Elevated Trading Insider Tip

Always ask to see the product’s [Certificate of Analysis (COA)](https://www.elevatedtrading.com/lab-results). A COA is an official report from an unbiased third-party lab that has analyzed the product. **Retailers should refuse to buy any hemp-derived product from a company that won’t provide third-party lab results.**

#### A COA should include:

- The percentage of Delta 8 in the product
- If any, the amount of THC in the product
- The concentration of other cannabinoids

Find a vendor that produces high-quality Delta 8 THC distillate with a fair price. While there is an abundance of companies to choose from, choose a supplier you can trust. Elevate.
