#### CBD Isolate Vs. CBD Distillate

:::

::: div col 12|6|8|8

Whatâ€™s the difference between CBD distillate and CBD isolate? CBD isolate is highly refined to contain only CBD. CBD distillate is a whole plant extract that includes a wide range of beneficial cannabinoids. Mile High Labs uses a proprietary process to remove nearly all of the THC present in our CBD distillate. The result is a THC-free, broad-spectrum CBD oil that manufacturers and their consumers can trust.
