      items:
        - item: Crude refers to the base product produced after the initial extraction
            process. This is the most accurate representation of the plant
            material post extraction. This "crude" oil still contains
            Chlorophyll, terpenes, flavonoids, and phytocannabinoids giving it a
            dark green to black hue. Once added to products it will transfer a
            brown to green coloration to the finished product. Crude is optimal
            for products that require a low price point where protecting flavor
            is not a concern. We recommend using in gel caps, pain creams,
            lotion, topicals, and tinctures where the natural flavors of the
            plant are encouraged.
