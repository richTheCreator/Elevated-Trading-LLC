99+% of CBN

Isolate is the purest form of CBN available. CBN Isolate is a pure, crystalline, and flavorless pharmaceutical grade powder that is 99+% pure CBN. This is the end result of the refining process once everything has been removed except for the CBN molecules themselves. Isolate is the only way to achieve true zero THC present end products. Isolate is useful for nearly every CBN product on the market when minor cannabinoid and phytocannabinoid flavors are not desired. Isolate is optimal for products where absolute zero THC can be present and ease of dosing are important factors.
