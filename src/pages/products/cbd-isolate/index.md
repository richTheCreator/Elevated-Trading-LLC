99+% of CBD 

Isolate is the purest form of CBD available. CBD Isolate is a pure, crystalline, and flavorless pharmaceutical grade powder that is 99+% pure CBD. This is the end result of the refining process once everything has been removed except for the CBD molecules themselves. Isolate is the only way to achieve true zero THC present end products. Isolate is useful for nearly every CBD product on the market when minor cannabinoid and phytocannabinoid flavors are not desired. Isolate is optimal for products where absolute zero THC can be present and ease of dosing are important factors.
