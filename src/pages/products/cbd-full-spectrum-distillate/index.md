        - item: Elevated Trading's distillate is refined in a highly controlled
            environment to ensure the highest quality on the market. Our
            distillate has a golden to amber hue and the consistency of honey
            when warmed. Most of the flavonoids and phytocannabinoids have been
            removed leaving little adverse taste. This makes our distillate
            optimal for products with mid to high levels of CBD concentration
            without altering the flavor.
