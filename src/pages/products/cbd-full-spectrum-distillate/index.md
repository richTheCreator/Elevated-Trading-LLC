Around 85% CBD - around 5% to 15% minor cannabinoids (CBC, CBG, CBN)

Elevated Trading's wholesale full spectrum distillate is refined in a highly controlled environment to ensure the highest quality on the market. Our wholesale distillate has a golden to amber hue and the consistency of honey when warmed. Most of the flavonoids and phytocannabinoids have been removed leaving little adverse taste. This makes our wholesale distillate optimal for products with mid to high levels of CBD concentration without altering the flavor. We recommend using in vape cartridges, tinctures, gummies, chocolates, caramels, and other edible products where maintaining delicate flavors is important.
