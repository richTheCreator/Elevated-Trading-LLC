    Our wholesale T2 CBD flower is ideal for those users looking for an
    energizing clear headed experience. Strong citrus notes, a clean earthy
    finish, and a very smooth smoke are what you can expect from the wholesale
    T1 flower. The cannabinoid profile on this flower is robust, and users will
    be thrilled with the “entourage effect” that comes from smoking the
    wholesale T1 flower. This strain makes a great daily smoke, and we include
