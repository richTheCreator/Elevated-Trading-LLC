Are you interested in getting your hemp flower treated with Delta 8 distillate and CBG kief to create a Delta 8 infused flower product? We can help. 

Through our proprietary application process, we apply a generous amount of our Delta 8 distillate and CBG kief to your hemp flower. Our misting process allows the Delta 8 distillate to coat the buds evenly and consistently so you get a top-shelf finished product.

This is a turnkey service that will increase the profitability and marketability of your CBD hemp flower.

We offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee on the process, and we stand behind each pound of hemp flower that leaves our facility.  

Note: The quality of your input material will directly affect the output material. Coating your flower with Delta 8 distillate and CBG kief will increase the cannabinoid content of the flower, but it will not drastically change the appearance of your bud structure. 

Each component of the process is 3rd party lab-tested and compliant for the 2018 Farm Bill. All products listed on the site and in our process are hemp-derived, federally legal, and contain less than 0.3% Delta-9 THC.
