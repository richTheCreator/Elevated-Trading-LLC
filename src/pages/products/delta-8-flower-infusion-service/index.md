Are you interested in getting your hemp flower treated with Delta 8 distillate and CBG kief to create a Delta 8 infused flower product? We can help. 

Through our proprietary application process, we apply a generous amount of our Delta 8 distillate and CBG kief to your hemp flower. Our misting process allows the Delta 8 distillate to coat the buds evenly and consistently so you get a top-shelf finished product.

This is a turnkey service that will increase the profitability and marketability of your CBD hemp flower.

We offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee on the process, and we stand behind each pound of hemp flower that leaves our facility.  

Note: The quality of your input material will directly affect the output material. Coating your flower with Delta 8 distillate and CBG kief will increase the cannabinoid content of the flower, but it will not drastically change the appearance of your bud structure.

## What is Delta 8? 

Delta 8 THC, short for Delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol, is just one of the many cannabinoids present in the cannabis plant. Delta 8 is naturally occurring in the cannabis plant, but only in trace amounts. The majority of the Delta 8 on the market today is hemp-derived by isolating CBD from hemp flower and then converting the CBD isolate into Delta 8 distillate. The effects of Delta 8 do create a psychoactive effect, or "high", but it is much less potent than the Delta 9 THC which is typically associated with cannabis.

All of the Delta 8 products sold by Elevated Trading are hemp-derived and contain less than 0.3% Delta 9 THC making the product federally legal under the 2018 Farm Bill.
