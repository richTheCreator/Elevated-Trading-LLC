Delta 8 THC (D8), short for Delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol, is just one of the many cannabinoids present in the cannabis plant. Delta 8 is naturally occurring in the cannabis plant, but only in trace amounts. The majority of the Delta 8 on the market today is hemp-derived by isolating CBD from hemp flower and then converting the CBD isolate into Delta 8 distillate. The effects of Delta 8 do create a psychoactive effect, or "high", but it is much less potent than the Delta 9 THC which is typically associated with cannabis.

All of the Delta 8 products sold by Elevated Trading are hemp-derived and contain less than 0.3% Delta 9 THC making the product federally legal under the 2018 Farm Bill.
